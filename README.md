# FIFA Rankings
This is a simple database management tool for FIFA Rankings. The official top 20 ranked teams are automatically imported (for the sake of convenience) into the database by web scraping the Wikipedia page for FIFA World Rankings. The tool contains functionality for:
- adding a team
- deleting a team
- changing a team's rating
- updating the ratings of two teams based on the result of a match played between them. This is done through a webpage.

### Usage
Enter the following command in your terminal while you are in the directory containing `app.py`
```
python -m flask run
```
Now, click on the link and it will take you to the webpage.
